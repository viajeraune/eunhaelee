<p>I'm a dual master's candidate in Engineering Management (<a href="https://idm.mit.edu/">Integrated Design and Management</a>) and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a>) at MIT, graduating in May 2024. My focus is on building user-centered and responsible applications of AI/ML technologies in ways that boost human creativity, productivity, and well-being. </p>

<p>I combine 8+ years of experience in building tech products for positive impact, my graduate training in <strong>human-centered design</strong> and <strong>computer science/AI</strong>, and my undergrad training in <strong>anthropology</strong> and the liberal arts, to <span>design and deliver products that empower people and communities.</span> </p>

<!-- <p>I can wear many hats, but one of my favorite lens through which I see the field of AI/ML is human-centered design ‚Äî how can we harness the power of technology to build products and businesses that truly benefit the world? How can we integrate invaluable insights from social sciences and humanities to be more intentional about the future we‚Äôre designing?</p> -->

    <p>üí° I'm a generalist with a specialist's eye and a bias towards execution.</p>
    <p>‚ú®Ô∏è My superpower is finding a path from 0 to 1; being creatively resourceful along the way while being laser-focused on the end goal.</p>
    <p>ü™Ñ I thrive in environments wired for learning, collaboration, creativity, and ownership. </p>
    <p>üß≠ My life principle: "My life starts at the end of my comfort zone."</p>
