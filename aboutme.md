<p>I'm a dual master's candidate in Engineering Management (<a href="https://idm.mit.edu/">Integrated Design and Management</a>) and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT, graduating in May 2024. My focus is on building responsible and user-centered applications of AI/ML technologies in ways that boost human creativity, productivity, and well-being. </p>

<p>I combine my graduate training in human-centered design and computer science, my undergrad training in anthropology and the liberal arts, and my 8+ years of experience in building tech products for positive impact to <span>deliver products that empower people and communities.</span> </p>

<!-- <p>I can wear many hats, but one of my favorite lens through which I see the field of AI/ML is human-centered design ‚Äî how can we harness the power of technology to build products and businesses that truly benefit the world? How can we integrate invaluable insights from social sciences and humanities to be more intentional about the future we‚Äôre designing?</p> -->
