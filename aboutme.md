<p>I'm an interdisciplinary product leader with a passion for designing great products that empower people and boost creativity, productivity, and well-being. I just completed a dual master's degree in Engineering Management (<a href="https://idm.mit.edu/">Integrated Design and Management</a>) and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a>) at MIT in September 2024.</p>

<p>I combine 8+ years of experience in building tech products for positive societal impact, my background in <strong>human-centered design</strong>, <strong>AI/ML</strong>, and <strong>anthropology and psychology</strong>, to <span>design and deliver products that push the boundaries of effective human-AI collaboration.</span> </p>

<p>For me, a great product starts with empathy and a deep understanding of user needs. Once truly internalized, these insights become the foundation for innovative, and sometimes unconventional, ideas. By combining this understanding with a first-principles approach, we can unlock groundbreaking solutions that redefine what's possible.</p>

<!-- <p>I can wear many hats, but one of my favorite lens through which I see the field of AI/ML is human-centered design ‚Äî how can we harness the power of technology to build products and businesses that truly benefit the world? How can we integrate invaluable insights from social sciences and humanities to be more intentional about the future we‚Äôre designing?</p> -->

<!-- <blockquote>You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

<p>A few things about how I work:</p>
<div>
    <p>üí° I'm a generalist with a specialist's eye and a bias towards execution.</p>
    <p>‚ú®Ô∏è My superpower is finding a path from 0 to 1; being creatively resourceful along the way while being laser-focused on the end goal.</p>
    <p>ü™Ñ I thrive in environments wired for learning, collaboration, creativity, and ownership. </p>
    <p>üß≠ My life principle: "My life starts at the end of my comfort zone."</p>
</div>
